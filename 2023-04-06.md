## Notes

- we started this repo and started laying out some general topics to start discussing checkout the [readme](./readme.md).
- let machines not have access to plain text and annotations, but also a db that this annotations are refering to
- LLMs that cna process this graph of information would be amazing
- Iian did a demo about Codex and how annotations can be used to not only meaning but also visual aspects, like alignment, format, page breaks and even animations!!!
- Iiam mentioned how a graph view of the annotations and the meaning we add to data can help writers to understand if the meaning of things change during time and help them understand what they are writing
- Temporal views can be interesting too to help understand what happens when. because sometines temporal data is important.
- having annotations as stand-off can help to create multiple views of the same content, by creating a graph of all the connected concepts, or creating a list of all the entities annotated. this could help others understand the right meaning that the writer was thinking about.
- another crazy idea: what if anything can bring its own annotations to help understand what is being written? what if a particular author is "annotated" to help readers get the right context of that particular author and understand its ideas and content better?
- Usually stand-off is transparent to normal users, but the social aspects is interesting because we can give meaning to the stand-off based on user's actions, like adding meaning to verses in lyrics, and other users can add more meaning on top of your explanation
- I just remember how Photoshop layers help transform images without applying anything to the original source. this are a way of annotations too
