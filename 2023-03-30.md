## stand-off properties

- different types of stand-off
- textual metadata that is stored external to the text
- let you treat plain data
- let you overlap properties
- let you mix and match different types of properties (format and semantics)
- stand-off revolution
  - it actually captures peoples intentions
  - social benefits
- Codex treats every character as its own cell

  - gives a lot of flexibility
  - store more data
  - accessing the part of the DOM of that cel is almost instant
  - it opens a long list of possibilities
  - it could also include behavior to the metadata. its super powerfull

  - example: transcribe content from another: you can mark when one page start and what other page ends

- stand-off should not be seen just to work to plain text streams. if could be applied to any type of text

- we should share more about stand-off properties and our own constraints and limitations
- stand-off properties is a simple paradigm that leads to a much more complex possibilities, and there are natural similarities in the ways we implement them.
